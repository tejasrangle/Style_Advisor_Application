### Future Work

- Multi-modal Recommendations:
To Expand the system to include recommendations not just based on images but also on textual input, such as written descriptions of style preferences.

- Incorporate Natural Language Processing (NLP):

Implement an NLP component to process user-written descriptions or comments about their style preferences. This could improve the recommendation accuracy and add an interactive element.
